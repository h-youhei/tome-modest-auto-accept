# tome4 Modest Auto-accept
Base Game's Auto-accept target is too aggressive for me.
This Addon provides restricted version of Auto-accept target.
Auto-accept target if there is only one seen creature.

This addon ignores Auto-accept target setting.

Future update(Maybe):
Auto-accept creature hovering by mouse.
I can't figure out how to distinguish from last attacked creature. Help welcome.
