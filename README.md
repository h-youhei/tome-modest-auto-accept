# tome4 Modest Auto-accept
Base Game's Auto-accept target is too aggressive for me.
This Addon provides restricted version of Auto-accept target.
Auto-accept target if there is only one seen creature or you are hovering a creature by mouse.

Prevent some Talents from Auto-accept target.
- Demented/Controlled-horrors/Decayed Bloated Horror

This addon ignores Auto-accept target setting.
You can toggle Modest Auto-accept target by 'Toggle automatic accept target option' hotkey.
Disable means Both of Modest Auto-accept and Base Game's Auto-accept are disabled regardless of 'Auto-accept target' setting.
